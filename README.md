# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-OpenCV

## 🚀 Introduction
This project is a real-time face mask detection system that uses computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to determine if an individual is wearing a mask.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Detect faces in real-time video streams.
- **Mask Classification**: Classify faces as "Mask" or "No Mask".
- **Visual Feedback**: See results directly on the video feed with labels and confidence percentages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Flask**: Lightweight web server to serve the video feed and results.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for deep learning model creation and execution.
- **OpenCV**: Comprehensive computer vision library.
- **cvzone**: Utility library to simplify tasks in OpenCV.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikumaradapa/Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-OpenCV/.git
